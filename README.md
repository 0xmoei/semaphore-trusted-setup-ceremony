## FAQs
Q: I received the message ‚ÄúYour contribution took longer than the estimated time and you were removed as the current contributor.‚Äù What should I do?
<img width="1600" height="71" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bea707ab-05fd-4154-bbc3-4a27e2ec7933" />

A: If your connection is slow, some contribution steps may take longer than expected, which can lead to a timeout, often during file download and upload. When this happens, you are automatically removed as the current contributor. You will need to wait for the predefined timeout period to expire before you can rejoin and continue your contribution. Once the timeout has passed, you may restart from the same circuit. To avoid repeated timeouts, we recommend switching to a machine with a faster and more stable internet connection before attempting to try again.

Here are some timeout examples:

Q: I received the message ‚ÄúThe waiting time (timeout) to retry the contribution has not yet expired.‚Äù What should I do?

<img width="1534" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae7fad2f-0bd5-4092-aca2-c617d15e8130" />

A: After a timeout occurs‚Äîusually due to a slow or unstable connection, or disk availability issues‚Äîyou must wait for the predefined timeout period to expire before you can retry your contribution. Attempting to rejoin before this period ends will result in this message. Please wait until the timeout has fully passed, then try again. To improve your chances of a successful contribution, we recommend switching to a machine with a faster and more stable internet connection and ensuring there is sufficient free disk space for the process to complete successfully.
